            Stammering, also known as stuttering, affects approximately 5% of children worldwide, 
            often leading to significant educational challenges, social anxiety, and reduced self-esteem 
            during critical developmental years. Traditional speech therapy, while effective, faces 
            limitations in accessibility, consistency, and personalization.

            This project presents <strong className="text-primary">SpeakEasy</strong>, an innovative 
            AI-powered mobile application designed to provide personalized, engaging, and accessible 
            stammer therapy for children aged 4-12. Leveraging advanced speech recognition algorithms 
            and machine learning models, the application analyzes speech patterns in real-time, 
            identifies disfluencies, and delivers targeted exercises through gamified interactions.

            The expected outcomes include measurable improvement in speech fluency, increased therapy 
            engagement through child-friendly interfaces, and valuable insights for speech therapists 
            through comprehensive progress tracking. This research contributes to the growing field of 
            AI-assisted healthcare, demonstrating the potential of technology to democratize access to 
            quality speech therapy services.
